# Regression with SciKit Learn

This goes alongside the blog post ["Regression With Scikit Learn (Part 3)"](https://blog.dennisokeeffe.com/blog/2021-08-16-regression-with-scikit-learn-part-three).

This kit expects that you're using Conda (although other package managers and virtual environment managers are fine).

## Prerequisites

For this base template, you will need to install a few base packages.

```s
$ conda install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib ipykernel

# ... conda install output
```

## Docs folder

`docs/` contains some Python Notebooks. In order to run, there will be some requirements.
